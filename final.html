<img Src="edu-ind-vd-abroad-360x270.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width=100px Height=100px">
<p style="color:Blue;">We used to compare our India with other countries in other facilities and laws, then why? We are not comparing our education system with other foreign countries. • Comparing to foreign countries in India we had Dhiru Bahi Ambani who proved that a common man can became a billionaire, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam who dared to build missiles for India . • Such people though in small numbers because of these people lining up in top ranks in education.But what is my question is, whether they are the products of our Indian education system? • No, they are self driven and inspired by themselves, and reached the high-end in their life. • Foreign education system leads the students to get international recognized qualification, so that students can look forward to good career prospects when they complete their education.</p>

<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Indian To Do to Improve Education System</h1>
<p style="color:Blue;"> There is many changes should be made to improve the quality of our Indian education system. • Indian government needs to invest large amount in order to develop the infrastructure of schools and colleges. • Methods of teaching needs more change, Teachers should encourage the students to think logically & to increase creativity in students. The biographies of successful persons should be a part of the syllabus, so that students can mould their personalities. • In India, the physical education has no primary importance with comparing to other subjects, there is no proper syllabus and no regular periods are allocated for physical education. • Only in India the national game hockey has no more importance that other country nation game cricket</p>
